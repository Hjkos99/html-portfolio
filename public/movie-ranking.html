<h3> Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>It is the best Ghibli animation film that I ever seen. The art style, the storytelling, the effects and the characters are amazing. It's very recommended.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
    <p>It is an action film where a retired hitmans wife died. Her last gift to him was a puppy that was killed by maffia gang during a house break to stole his favorite car. He was hurt but he sweared for avenge. The story is amazing and actions are fantastic. Absolute cinema.</p>

<h3>K-pop Demon Hunters</h3>
    <p>One word only: OMG. This anime is a masterpiece. The music and story is legendary. There is action, music, love and Platon love, a typically K-drama film.</p>
